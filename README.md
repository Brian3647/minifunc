Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. If using bun, you can run tests with `bun test`. Most of the work is automated by husky (with the `pre-comit` hook) that you can install with `bun run prepare` or `npm run prepare`. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
